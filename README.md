# Federated Learning with FedAvg

This repository contains an implementation of **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)** for multiple datasets, including **CIFAR-10, FEMNIST, and EMNIST**.  
The project is designed to help researchers and students understand and experiment with **federated learning** concepts.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- FedAvg implementation using PyTorch  
- Configurable **communication rounds** (default: `200`)  
- Configurable **local epochs per client** (default: `50`)  
- **Dataset flexibility**: switch between CIFAR-10, FEMNIST, and EMNIST by changing one line  
- Tracks model accuracy across communication rounds
